This is my first coding project at Flatiron School. 
It scrapes a pokemon database and allows you to interact with it within the console on your computer

To run the program, inside of the main app directory run, `ruby bin/pokdex`

A preview of how the application works can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF9te2AkvvI
